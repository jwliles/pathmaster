## Legend

- ✅ Complete: Feature is fully implemented
- 🚧 In Progress: Implementation has started but is not complete
- ⏳ Planned: Feature is planned but implementation has not started
- ❌ Not Planned: Feature is not planned for this implementation

## Current Development Focus

The current development focus is on implementing the core functionality of the Go version, including:

1. Path management functions
2. Shell detection and integration
3. CLI command structure
4. Validation logic
5. Basic backup system

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Core + v0.3.0 features)**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 2 (TUI implementation)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3 (v0.5.0 preparation)**: 1-2 weeks

This timeline is approximate and may change based on development progress.
