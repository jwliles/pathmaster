## **Introduction**

**pathmaster** is a powerful command-line tool written in Rust for managing your system's `PATH` environment variable. It simplifies the process of adding and removing directories from your `PATH`, ensures backups are created automatically, and provides tools to restore previous configurations.

Managing the `PATH` variable is crucial for system performance and command execution. `pathmaster` provides a safe and efficient way to handle `PATH` modifications, with features designed to prevent errors and maintain system stability.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Rust Toolchain**: Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

### **Building from Source**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jwliles/pathmaster.git
   cd pathmaster
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

   This command compiles the project in release mode, producing an optimized binary.

3. **Install the Binary**

   Optionally, you can install the binary system-wide:

   ```bash
   sudo cp target/release/pathmaster /usr/local/bin/
   ```

   Or add it to your `PATH`:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Command Overview**

```bash
pathmaster [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

### **Commands**

#### **add**

Add a directory to your `PATH`.

**Usage:**

```bash
pathmaster add <directory>
```

**Options:**

- `<directory>`: The directory path to add to your `PATH`.

#### **remove**

Remove a directory from your `PATH`.

**Usage:**

```bash
pathmaster remove <directory>
```

**Options:**

- `<directory>`: The directory path to remove from your `PATH`.

#### **list**

List all current entries in your `PATH`.

**Usage:**

```bash
pathmaster list
```

#### **check**

Validate current PATH entries and identify invalid or missing directories.

**Usage:**

```bash
pathmaster check
```

**Example Output:**

```bash
Invalid directories in PATH:
  /home/user/.config/emacs/bin
  /home/user/old/scripts
```

#### **flush**

The `flush` command provides a safe way to remove invalid directories from your PATH:

**Usage:**

```bash
pathmaster flush
# or
pathmaster -f
```

**Process:**

1. Creates a backup of current PATH
2. Creates a backup of shell configuration file
3. Identifies invalid directory entries
4. Removes invalid entries from PATH
5. Updates shell configuration for persistence
6. Provides detailed feedback about changes

**Safety Features:**

- Automatic PATH backup creation
- Shell configuration file backup
- Detailed removal reporting
- Recovery options via backup system
- Session-only fallback if configuration update fails

**Example Output:**

```bash
Created backup of shell config at: /home/user/.bashrc.bak
Removing invalid path: /home/user/.config/emacs/bin
Removing invalid path: /home/user/old/scripts
Successfully removed 2 invalid path(s) and updated shell configuration.
```

#### **history**

Show the backup history of your `PATH`.

**Usage:**

```bash
pathmaster history
```

#### **restore**

Restore your `PATH` from a previous backup.

**Usage:**

```bash
pathmaster restore [--timestamp <timestamp>]
```

**Options:**

- `--timestamp <timestamp>`: (Optional) The timestamp of the backup to restore. If not provided, the most recent backup is used.

### **Examples**

- **Add a Directory to PATH**

  ```bash
  pathmaster add ~/my/custom/bin
  ```

- **Remove a Directory from PATH**

  ```bash
  pathmaster remove ~/my/old/bin
  ```

- **List PATH Entries**

  pathmaster list
  ```

  **Sample Output:**

  ```
  Current PATH entries:
  - /usr/local/bin
  - /usr/bin
  - /bin
  - /usr/local/sbin
  - /usr/sbin
  - /sbin
  - ~/my/custom/bin
  ```

- **Show Backup History**

  ```bash
  pathmaster history
  ```

  **Sample Output:**

  ```
  Available backups:
  - backup_20231007_120000.json
  - backup_20231008_090000.json
  ```

- **Restore PATH from a Specific Backup**

  ```bash
  pathmaster restore --timestamp 20231007_120000
  ```

- **Restore PATH from the Most Recent Backup**

  ```bash
  pathmaster restore
  ```

## **Configuration**

pathmaster now supports configurable backup modes to provide more control over what gets backed up during operations. This can be especially useful when:

- You want to focus on PATH management without shell configuration changes
- You need to manage shell configurations separately
- You want to minimize backup file creation
- You're testing different PATH configurations

`pathmaster` modifies your shell configuration file to make changes to `PATH` persistent across sessions.

- **Supported Shells**: Bash (`.bashrc`), Zsh (`.zshrc`), or a generic `.profile` if the shell is not recognized.
- **Backup Directory**: Backups are stored in `~/.pathmaster_backups`.

**Note**: Always review changes made to your shell configuration files. `pathmaster` adds an export command to update your `PATH`.

## **Backup Management**

pathmaster provides flexible backup management with configurable backup modes:

### **Backup Modes**

Use the `--backup-mode` flag to control what gets backed up:

- `default`: Back up both PATH and shell configurations (default behavior)
- `path`: Back up only PATH entries
- `shell`: Back up only shell configuration
- `switch`: Toggle between PATH-only and shell-only backups

**Examples:**

```bash
# Only back up PATH when adding a directory
pathmaster --backup-mode path add ~/bin

# Only back up shell config when flushing invalid paths
pathmaster --backup-mode shell flush

# Reset to backing up both
pathmaster --backup-mode default

# Toggle between backup modes
pathmaster --backup-mode switch
```

### **Backup Storage**

- **PATH Backups**: Stored as JSON files in `~/.pathmaster_backups`
- **Shell Configuration Backups**: Created as `.bak` files alongside your shell config:
  - Bash: `~/.bashrc.bak`
  - Zsh: `~/.zshrc.bak`
  - Generic: `~/.profile.bak`
